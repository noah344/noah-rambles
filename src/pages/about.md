I'm Noah, I wear a lot of hats. Sysadmin, security engineer, developer, team lead/team therapist, project manager. You name it, I've probably done it.

## What's this for?

This blog is here to share my thoughts sometimes, post about some of the stuff I do, and maybe help me get a new job!

Here's a link to my [Github](https://github.com/noah344) and one for my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah--harris/) and if you want to shoot me an [email](mailto:noah-rambles.com), there ya go.

## Ok cool but what's it made of?

This site was built using [astro](https://astro.build/) along with the wonderful [astro paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme. I'd love to say that I made it look this nice on my own but 90% of the work was done with the template.
